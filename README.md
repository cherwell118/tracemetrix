## Data 
1. The case study data in the article is sourced from the literature: Wan L, Liu Q, Liang D, Guo Y, Liu G, Ren J, He Y, and Shan B (2021) Circulating Tumor Cell and Metabolites as Novel Biomarkers for Early-Stage Lung Cancer Diagnosis. Front. Oncol. 11:630672. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.630672IF
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
              
2. The data is derived from early-stage lung cancer samples, which include 30 cancer samples, 30 healthy individual samples, and 8 QC (Quality Control) samples. Each type of sample contains both positive and negative modes. All data including MS/MS informations.
3. Due to the upload limitations on GitHub, all the original data files have been compressed using 7z and segmented.
## R code
1. R function contains the underlying R code for all analytical functions in TraceMatrix.
2. R packge including some R functions were used in analytical functions
